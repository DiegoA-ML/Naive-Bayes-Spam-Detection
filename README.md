# Naive-Bayes-Spam-Detection
This project aimed to mitigate the growing challenge of spam emails, which now make up nearly 45% of global email traffic. We developed a spam classification system based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, leveraging natural language processing techniques to accurately filter emails into spam and non-spam categories.
